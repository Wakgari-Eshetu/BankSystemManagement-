oop in python 
oop helps developer to biuld modular , mantainable and scalable application .

it helps to group the code as classes and object
object has thing or attribute that has specific data and 
perform certain operation using methods

1. class: collection of the objects or the blueprint for an object
 defines a set of attributes and method an object of that class can have 

ojects can be method and variable 
1. variable: used for assign the value to it.
 variable type in python 
 a.public: by deafult all the variable inside the class is 
 deafult(can be assecciable inside the class and outside the class)
 b.protected: assecciable but not recommended defined using one underscore before the name
 c.private: assecciable only inside the class defined using two underscores before the name 


depending the asseccibility inside the class it can be 
1. insatance: inside method in class to update we need to use the 
classrepresentative.varname = "something"
2. class variable : outside any method in class update it using the class name like
classname.variablename = "something new"
-------------------- -------------------- -------------------- 
2.Method: is function inside the class 
 there are three type of class 

 1. instance method: the deafult that take self as the first parameters
 2. class method: has decoreator called @classMethod take
cls as first parameter instead of self .
 3. static method: niether of them and dont take self or cls as the fisrt parameter
